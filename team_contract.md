# Team Contract (dm32-sawhney4-adityaj5-jjkuang2)


# Communication

## Team Meetings
The team will meet every Sunday from 7-8PM using Zoom. There will be a running to-do document that lists all items of interest that members can write to during the meeting.


## Assistance
Each member can be contacted through Discord and expect a response within 24 hours (this does not necessarily mean resolving an issue, just replying).

## Respect
Each team member will make sure that everyone is included in the discussions and create an environment where people can give ideas without them being overlooked. 
We will also take notes during the meeting to make sure that everyone is attentive and listening.

# Collaboration

## Work Distribution
Each week, the team will come up with issues in Github that should be resolved by 1-2 people depending on the task. Each member can volunteer to take on an issue, 
but if no one volunteers, 1-2 team members will be randomly assigned depending on the size of the issue. If the work assigned has complications or setbacks, the team member
is not expected to complete it alone.

## Time Commitment
To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project. If 
an issue ends up running into complications, other team members will assist to finish the incomplete work. 

If a team member is consistently unable to finish issues, they will be asked to explain their circumstances. Based on this response, further course of action can be determined
by the rest of the team.

## Conflict Resolution
All decisions will be resolved through a simple majority vote ( > %50), in the case of a tie, we will try and compromise and if we cannot come to a comprise, we will 
consult the final project mentor.

## Coding Protocol
Each member should try to write readable code that is documented to some degree. Non-finished code should be pushed to a branch. Each pull request for a branch should 
be reviewed by at least one team member.
